# VERIABLES IN PYTHON EXPLAINED

# Variable:
# A variable is a name given to any storage area or
# memory location in a program.
#
# In simple words, we can say that a variable is a
# container that contains some information, and whenever we need
# that information, we use the name of that container to access it.
# Let's create a variable:



#ver1 =  "hello woeld \n"
#ver4 = " prince kumar"
ver1 = "78"
ver2 = "90"
ver3 = 1.23
ver4 = 4
"""""
print("Enter you numbers ")
inpnum = input()
print("you entered",int (inpnum)+10)

#print (30*  str (int (ver1) + int (ver2)))
#print (10*"prince is very nice person\n" )
"""
"""
str() = hello
int() = 78
float() = 1.23
"""
print("Enter you frist number")
n1 = input()
print("Enter you scornd number")
n2 = input()
print("The sum of these numbers",int(n1) + int(n2))

#print (type(ver3) )
