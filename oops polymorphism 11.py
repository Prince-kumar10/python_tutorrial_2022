# What Is Polymorphism?
# In the basic English language, Polymorphism means to exist in
# different states. The same object or thing changing its state from one form to another is known as
# polymorphic. The same function or method, being used differently in different scenarios, can perfectly
# describe Polymorphism. It occurs mostly with base and derived classes.
