# OPERATORS IN PYTHONS


# Arithmetic operator
# Assignment operator
# comparison operator
# Logical  operator
# Indentity operator
# Membership operator
# Bitwise operator




# Arithmetic operator
# print("5 + 6 is", 5+6)
# print("5 - 6 is", 5-6)
# print("5 ** 3 is", 5**3)
# print("5 // 6 is", 5//6)
# print("5 % 6 is", 5%6)

# Assignment operator
# x = 5
# x +=4
# x -=4
# x *=4
# x /=4
# print(x)

# comparison operator
# i = 5
# print(i<=5)
# print(i==5)
# print(i>=5)
# print(i and 5)

# Logical operator
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and a)
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)
# print(a is b)

# Indentity operator
# print(a is not b)

# Membership operator
list1 = [12,34,56,78,90,76 ]
print( 56 in list1)
print( 563 not in list1)

# # Bitwise operator
# 0 = 00
# 0 = 01
# 2 = 10
# 3 = 11

print(0 | 1)
print(0 & 1)
